        "body": "The 28 times table, though it may seem challenging, becomes manageable with practice. Learning the 28 x table is crucial as it establishes a foundation for advancing mathematical proficiency. Every product in the 28x table is an even number, and is also divisible by 9. Knowing this table boosts confidence in students' math abilities and improves their computational skills. It facilitates a better understanding of the relationships between numbers and supports more complex calculations. An interesting fact about 28 is that it's a perfect number, equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, excluding itself. See the twenty-eight times table below.",
