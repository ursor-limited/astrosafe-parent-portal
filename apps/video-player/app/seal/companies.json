This is done through muscle memory and is called touch typing. The main advantage of touch typing is that typing can be done without the typist consciously thinking about each keystroke they are making. When you copy text from a source you no longer need to split your attention between the source, the screen and the keyboard. You do not have to interrupt your thinking to scan the keyboard for the right letter or to correct a typo.",

Some parents might argue that it seems counterintuitive to use an app that appears to validate a child's fears, but there is real value in the Monster Guard Method. We tell our children Santa, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny are all real, so it makes sense they then have difficulty believing monsters aren't, despite our repeated reassurances.\n\r\nRather than deny the existence of Monsters, when it comes to tackling teraphobia, Monster Guard takes a different approach, and it does so in two ways. Firstly, by empowering the child and enabling them to take control of their fear and secondly, by working to change their perception of Monsters. This is where the character \u2018Monty' comes in. With his heart-warming backstory, friendly, reassuring tone, and bedtime tales, Monty is the soul of the experience, a guardian-type character there to teach children that monsters aren't so scary after all. They are just furry and friendly creatures like himself. I truly believe this app could be a game changer for parents desperately searching for a solution to help their kids settle to sleep scare-free.",
