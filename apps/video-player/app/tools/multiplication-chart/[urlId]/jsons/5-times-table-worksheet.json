        "body": "The 5 times table is a basic math concept involving multiplying 5 by whole numbers. These calculations are very common, because multiples of 5 are used often in time, currency, and rounded numbers. Mastering the 5 x table is often linked to increased confidence in math. An interesting fact about the number 5 is its association with balance, being the midpoint between 1 and 10. Additionally, it universally symbolizes the human figure with five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot. Familiarity with the 5x table helps with calculations involving time and reading clocks. See the five times table below.",
