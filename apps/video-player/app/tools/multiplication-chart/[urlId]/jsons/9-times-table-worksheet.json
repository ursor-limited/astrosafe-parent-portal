        "body": "The 9 times table involves multiplying 9 with other integers. Proficiency in the 9 x table boosts students' confidence in math. There is an interesting trick to the 9x table. Students can try the 'finger trick': Hold up all 10 fingers. Starting with the left pinkie as number “1”, fold down the finger you wish to multiply by 9, and the remaining fingers will represent the product. For example, for 9 x 5, count to 5 fingers, starting at the left pinkie. Finger number five is the left thumb. Put down the left thumb, and you are left with 4 fingers on the left hand and 5 on the right. 9 x 5 = 45. Another interesting fact about the 9 x table is that if you add the digits of each product, they will add up to nine. For example: 9 x 6 = 54.  5 + 4 = 9. See the nine times table below.",
