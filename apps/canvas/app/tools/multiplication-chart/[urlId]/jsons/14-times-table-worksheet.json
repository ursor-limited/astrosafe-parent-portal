        "body": "The 14 times table involves multiplying 14 by whole numbers. Remembering it helps with mental calculations, which are important for school and everyday problem-solving. All the products in the 14x table are even numbers. Mastering the 14 x table enhances accuracy, speed, and confidence in math tasks. An interesting fact: 14 is the smallest even number formed by multiplying prime numbers greater than two (2×7). Understanding and using the 14 times table can spark curiosity about complex number patterns and prime factorization, which are big topics in advanced math. See the fourteen times table below.",
