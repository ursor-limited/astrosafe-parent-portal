Understanding the 0 x table reinforces this fundamental idea. Zero is neither positive nor negative but can be seen as the midpoint on the number line. Knowing the zero times table can boost students' confidence in math and introduces them to multiplication properties.  The 0x table illustrates that any number multiplied by zero always equals zero.",
