        "body": "The 15 times table is a crucial part of a student's math skills. It is particularly helpful in calculations involving time and reading clocks. It involves multiplying 15 by various whole numbers. Every product in the 15x table is a multiple of 5. Knowing the 15 x table helps develop mental math skills, understanding of ratio and proportion, and mastery of multiplication and division. Proficiency in the 15x table boosts confidence and is valuable in real-life situations like calculating discounts or currency exchange. Interestingly, every product in the 15 times table ends in either 0 or 5. See the fifteen times table below.",
