Each product in the 18 x table is an even number, divisible by 2 and also by 9. Interestingly, the digital sum (sum of digits) of each multiple of 18 is always 9 or multiples of 9, offering a unique way to check calculations involving 18. This highlights fascinating patterns within multiplication tables. See the eighteen times table below.",
