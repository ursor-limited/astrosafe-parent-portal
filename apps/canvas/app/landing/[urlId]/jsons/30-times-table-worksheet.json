        "body": "The 30 times table is important for students to understand. Like the 10 times table and 20 times table, every product in the 30 x table ends with a 0 in the ones digit. Understanding the 30x table is important for higher level math, geometry, and chemistry problems. It lays the foundation for learning higher multiplication techniques, crucial in algebraic problem-solving. Students fluent in the 30 times table often exhibit higher confidence in their mathematical capabilities. An interesting fact: 30 has a divisional property, evenly dividing into 60, 90, and 120, making it a common factor in time and angle calculations. See the thirty times table below.",
