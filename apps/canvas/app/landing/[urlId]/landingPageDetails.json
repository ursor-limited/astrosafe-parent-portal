You can braise the chicken to make a more concentrated sauce, which is delicious over buttered noodles.\n This recipe splits the difference. It begins by roasting a whole, butter-rubbed, Parmesan-rind-stuffed chicken and a head of garlic under high heat. The skin and butter brown, the garlic sweetens, the bird infuses with the nutty flavors of the cheese. The pot is deglazed with water, less than you would use in a soup, but more than for a braise. Then, the noodles cook in the same pot so they can take in all that flavored broth. In a final act of generosity, the noodles share their starches with the broth, thickening it into a sauce.",
